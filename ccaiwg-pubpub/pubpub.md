# Who is PubPub for?

Anyone who is interested in creating a community to publish open access content



# Why use PubPub?


## Collaborative editing

- Edit documents alone or in real-time with others
- Open document to the public for large-scale collaboration, reading, and annotation of drafts


## Rich media documents

## Context
- PubPub allows you connect your content to other content on the internet and to name the connection type (review, comment, preprint, translation, etc), providing greater context around your work
- What's more, these connection types are deposited to Crossref when you mint a DOI    


## Credit

## Open source
- All of the source code for the platofrm is available
- Platform can be independently hosted


## Other benefits
(might not be directly relevant to the WG's outputs)

	- PubPub provides up to 10 free DOIs per year and then charges $1/DOI after that



# Features


## Two types of publications


### Page
- A page on PubPub is a container of content. As such, it can both communicate information itself while often serving as entry point to other content within and outside of PubPub.
- Pages are designed by Community Admins using a series of different content block types


### Pub
- A Pub is the most specific unit of content on PubPub
- The creators of PubPub made up the word "Pub" because, much like with Communities, the definition and function of a Pub can change drastically from Community to Community. For example, a single Pub in one community can function as a book chapter, while a Pub in another can serve as a journal article, and in a third Community a Pub may contain the video of a webinar. Pubs as a unit of content are ours to create and share based on the goals and nature of our Community


## Two types of user:

- **Admin**: individual or individuals who manage a PubPub community. Admins can assume different roles and levels of access within a community
- **Collaborator**: someone who contributes to the publication of a pub through many possible roles, such as brainstorming, editing, co-authoring, fact checking, project managing, and reviewing. These roles can be created and assigned for each Pub to credit collaborators based on the [CRediT Taxonomy](https://casrai.org/credit/#:~:text=CRediT%20(Contributor%20Roles%20Taxonomy)%20is,contribution%20to%20the%20scholarly%20output.)
